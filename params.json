Use just the parts you need; see docs on [building](./docs/building.md). If you don't want to build your own, you can just use the full library which includes all modules, it's [here on GitHub](http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js).\r\n\r\n\r\n| Module              | Contains                                                                                            | Docs                         |\r\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\r\n| **sheetsee-core**   | **Included in any build**.

Built on Mapbox.js.              | [Doc](./docs/sheetsee-maps.md)   |\r\n| **sheetsee-charts** | Includes 3 basic d3 charts: bar, line and pie. You can also [use your own](docs/custom-charts.md).  | [Doc](./docs/sheetsee-charts.md) |\r\n\r\n## Spreadsheets!?\r\n\r\nGoogle Spreadsheets can be used as simple and collaborative databases, they make getting a data driven site going much easier than traditional databases. Read more about using spreadsheets for databases [here](./docs/basics.md).\r\n\r\n## In the Wild\r\n\r\nWhat can you make with **Sheetsee.js**? Lots of things, here are some examples:\r\n\r\n- [Hack-Spots](http://jlord.github.io/hack-spots)\r\n- [Combine with IFTTT](http://jlord.us/instagram/)\r\n- [Real Python Support Desk](http://www.realpython.com/support)\r\n\r\n**List your sheetsee project here: file an [issue or pull request](http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js).**\r\n\r\n# Resources & Documentation\r\n\r\nMore resources on using Sheetsee.js:\r\n\r\n| Getting Started | Ideas | Use | Demos |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| [About Sheetsee.js](./docs/about.md) | [Fork-n-Go](./docs/fork-n-go.md) | [Sheetsee-core](./docs/sheetsee-core.md) | [Table Demo](./demos/demo-table.html) |\r\n| [Building Sheetsee](./docs/building.md) | [Tips!](./docs/tips.md) | [Sheetsee-tables](./docs/sheetsee-tables.md) | [Table Demo](./demos/demo-table.html) |\r\n| [Basics](./docs/basics.md) | [Custom charts](./docs/custom-charts.md) | [Sheetsee-maps](./docs/sheetsee-maps.md) | [Map Demo](./demos/demo-map.html) |\r\n|  |  |  [Sheetsee-charts](./docs/sheetsee-charts.md) | [Chart Demo](./demos/demo-chart.html) |\r\n\r\n## Note on New Google Spreadsheets\r\n\r\nGoogle recently updated their Google Spreadsheets and the API. For a bit this was breaking things using the old API, including Tabletop. This has been fixed and the latest version of tabletop.js works on both old and new spreadsheets. **Be sure to include at least version 1.3.4 in your project.**\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
